These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the ![Filebeat-Playbook](https://github.com/kokorokat/ELK-Project/blob/master/filebeat-playbook.ymlfile) file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting traffic to the network.

The primary function of a load balancer is to spread workloads across multiple servers to prevent overloading servers, optimize productivity, and maximize uptime. Load balancers also add resiliency by rerouting live traffic from one server to another if a server falls prey to DDoS attacks or otherwise becomes unavailable. In this way, load balancers help to eliminate single points of failure, reduce the attack surface, and make it harder to exhaust resources and saturate links.

The advantage of the jump box is the ability to access devices in separate security and availability zones, like managing a host in a DMZ from trusted networks or computers. The ability to strictly prohibit SSH log in using password, as well as making sure that only strong keys are used is another security feature and an advantage of the jump box.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes in data and system logs.

Filebeat collects data about the file system. It logs information about the files system, including which files have changed and when. It is often used to collect log files from very specific files, those generated by Apache, the Nginx web server, MySQL databases and Microsoft Azure Tools.

Metricbeat records machine metrics, such as uptime.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name       | Function     | IP Address | Operating System |
|------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box   | Gateway      | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| DVWA-VM1   | Load Balancer| 10.0.0.7   | Linux            |
| DVWA-VM2   | Web Server   | 10.0.0.8   | Linux            |
| ELK-Server | ELK Stack    | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the jump box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresse: home network IP*

*not listed for privacy reasons


Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH key and by home network ip*.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name       | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses                          |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Jump Box   | Yes                 | home network IP*                              |
| DVWA-VM1   | No                  | 10.0.0.4; home network IP*                    |
| DVWA-VM2   | No                  | 10.0.0.4; 10.0.0.7; home network IP*          |
| ELK-Server | Yes                 | 10.0.0.4; 10.0.0.7; 10.0.0.8; home network IP*|

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because by configuring the security details on the control machine and run the associated playbook, all the remote hosts will automatically be updated with those details. That means you won’t need to monitor each machine for security compliance continually manually. And for extra security, an admin’s user ID and password aren’t retrievable in plain text on Ansible.

The playbook implements the following tasks:

1. Install Docker and verify you are in your Ansible container.
2. Create a new playbook: touch /etc/ansible/install-elk.yml.
3. Ensure that the header of the playbook must specify elkservers as the target hosts.
4. Write tasks that do the following:
- Runs the following command through the shell: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
- Installs the following packages:
docker.io: The Docker engine, used for running containers.
python-pip: Package used to install Python software.
docker: Python client for Docker. Required by ELK.
- Downloads the Docker container called sebp/elk.
- Configures the container to start with the following port mappings:
5601:5601
9200:9200
5044:5044
-Starts the container.

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- 10.0.0.7
- 10.0.0.8

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

Filebeat collects data about the file system. It collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the configuration file from your Ansible container to your ELK-Server VM.
- Update the configuration file to include the private IP of Elk-Server (10.0.0.6)
- Run the playbook, and navigate to curl localhost/setup.phpto check that the installation worked as expected.

_Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- The ansible-playbook command will run the contents of a playbook.yml file. The playbook file can be named anything you wish as long as it ends in .yml and it has the correct formatting. You copy it to the command: ansible-playbook my-playbook.yml

_Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? 
- Update /etc/ansible/filebeat-configuration.yml and add remote machines (include machine's IP's) to it.

How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?
- Filebeat:Because we are connecting our DVWA machines to the ELK server, we need to edit the file to include our ELK server's IP address. In the /etc/filebeat/filebeat-configuration.yml configuration file we replace the IP address with the IP address of the ELK machine.

ELK Server: We specify a remote user (*machine's admin name) in ansible.cfg file and we list the IP address of our ELK server in hosts file.
